The vine was easy to grab a hold of and would flatten out every so often so you could sit and rest. The sun was just about gone when your reached the top of the jungle canopy. Looking around you can not see where your next step is. Taking a step your foot finds something squishy and your foot slides right off the branch. Tiered and unable to see you go toppling off the branch and plummet to the ground. The world goes dark about half way down.",
