  "storyText": "*Alarm Noises* The alarm is blaring in your ears. Your eyes hurt to open, little bits of ice fall away as you blink adjusting to the light. As the haze in your mind clears, you push open your cryo-pod door and stumble out into the hallway. Around you there are pieces of the ship scattered and broken from some unknown force. Somewhere above you there is a crash and the whole ship shakes beneath your feet. You rush over to a nearby console to get a handel on what is going on. After panic flipping through screens you land on one that confirms that you have just reached you end destination of Meirsul. Another sceen shows that the ship has been caught in an asteroid field around the planet that was supposed to be gone by the time you arrived. A few screens later you see the most of the ship has been lost and the life support systems are failing. There looks to be a small pocket of life  several floors above you where you heard the crash. Being a recently graduated botanist you have had little experience with space craft and are unsure if you will be able to make it to the survivors. You know that you should be able to make it to your escape pod on the deck below if you leave now. There is a ladder that leads to the upper deck next to you and the path to the escape pods is down the hall what would you do?"
